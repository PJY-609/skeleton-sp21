# Trie

![trie](./figs/trie.PNG)

Have to decide on a mapping from letter to node. Three natural choices:
- DataIndexedCharMap, i.e. an array of all possible child links.
- Bushy BST.
- Hash Table.


Tries have very fast lookup times, as we only ever look at as many characters as they are in the data weâ€™re trying to retrieve. However, their chief advantage is the ability to efficiently support various operations not supported by other map/set implementations including:

- longestPrefixOf
- prefixMatches
- spell checking

Supports special string operations like longestPrefixOf and keysWithPrefix.
- keysWithPrefix is the heart of important technology like autocomplete.
  - Optimal implementation of Autocomplete involves use of a priority queue!
